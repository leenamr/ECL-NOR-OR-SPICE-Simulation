# ECL NOR/OR SPICE Simulation Project

This repository contains the simulation of Emitter-Coupled Logic (ECL) NOR and OR gates using LTSpice. The project focuses on analyzing the high-speed performance and low propagation delay of ECL circuits, which are crucial for high-frequency applications.

## Contents
- **ECL_Report.pdf**: The project report detailing the simulation setup, analysis, and results.
- **LTSpice_Files/**: Contains the LTSpice schematic and simulation files.
- **images/**: Contains images of the circuit schematic and simulation results.

## How to Run the Simulation
1. **Install LTSpice**: Download and install LTSpice from [Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html).
2. **Open the Schematic**: Navigate to the `LTSpice_Files` folder and open `ECL.asc`.
3. **Run the Simulation**: Click on the `Run` button in LTSpice to simulate the circuit.
4. **View Results**: The simulation results can be viewed in the `.plt` file or directly in LTSpice.

## Results
The simulation results confirm the high-speed performance of the ECL NOR and OR gates, with low propagation delay and efficient power consumption. Detailed analysis and calculations are provided in the report.
